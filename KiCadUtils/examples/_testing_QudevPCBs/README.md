`_test_generate_PCB.py` is the main script which should loop over all `.json` files in this directory and for each of them generate a KiCad pcb file (`.kicad_pcb`) in the `output` directory (may need to be created manually). After opening the generate KiCad pcb file, certain steps still need to be done manually, e.g. filling of the ground plane. This is done by pressing `b`. Once this is done, design rule checks should pass, except for a few warning about missing designators of footprints (this is normal; the footprints are currently generated without them and they are not needed for fabrication).

`lqd_routing.py`, `qdl_coordinate.py`, `qdl_helper.py` and `qdl_placement.py` are a minimal set of files picked out of `qdl` and `libqudev` to be able to use the routing functionality. It may be useful to restructure `libqudev/routing` at some point in a way that the low-level routing function can be used on its own without having to import all the bells and whistles (ports, placement, etc.)
